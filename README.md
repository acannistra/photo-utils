Python scripts for orchestrating photo backups.

raw-move.py
-----------
This utility is for the backup of RAW files. It fits nicely into a RAW --> JPG 
workflow, where the photographer keeps the JPG files on his or her hard drive
locally, and backs-up the RAW files elsewhere. It is currently configured to 
work with Canon raw files (.CR2). 
###Features
- Configurable for different types of RAW files.
- Checks for JPG copies of images in same folder.
- Creates backup directory safely.
